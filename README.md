# Discngine Connector - TIBCO Spotfire&reg; mashup application
This small application demonstrates how to build a mashup application with TIBCO Spotfire&reg; using the [Discngine Connector](https://connector.discngine.com)
With it you can interact with the Spotfire Document, load data, add charts, listen to events and so on.

## Technology
The Discngine Connector is a standard Javascript API, thus it can be used with any modern Javascript framework like [React](https://reactjs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Here, we use a basic Node.js server and a vanilla JS front-end page.

With it you will be able to load a remote CSV file as Data Table and add it in a Table Plot. Then we will add a marking listener which will display in the application basic statistics about the selected rows.

## Tutorial
The full tutorial on how this app was built is available on the [Discngine Connector website](https://connector.discngine.com/tutorial-Create%20an%20example%20app%20with%20Node.html).
